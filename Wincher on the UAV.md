# Abstract
## Winch System
&emsp;The winch system on UAV consists of a support base, a motor with a reducer, a winch and a tethered metal block.
The winch system can be easily strapped to the abdomen of various UAVs and it is reponsible for two tasks.  
&emsp;First, the winch system releases the metal block which is like a "decoy" to the magnetic catcher to establish a connection.  
&emsp;Second, it also provides the driving forces to enable UAV declining until touching down the landing pad.
