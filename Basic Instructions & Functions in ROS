# Introduction
This passage records all the instructions & functions I met during ros learning.

# Main

- roscore
Used for launching ros master. It should be enter before launch the ros system

- rosrun
Used for launching the node instruction in a package. It includes two parameter: package_name & node_name

- rosbag
Used for recording all the topic data in the system, and repeat in the next time.

```
$ rosbag record -a -O cmd_record
// -a implies recording all data
// -O saves the data as compressed package, following a file name
```

- advertise()
You tell ROS that you want to publish specific type message on the topic;  
Then master will inform all the nodes which subscribe this topic, set up a network.

- ros::spin(), ros::spinOnce()
